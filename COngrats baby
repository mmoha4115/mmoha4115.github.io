<h1>Children are a blessing for the Family and The Ummah</h1>
<p> Praise be to Allaah.  

Abu Dawood (2050) narrated that Ma’qil ibn Yasaar said: 
<b>A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “I have found a woman who is of good lineage and is beautiful, but she does not children. Should I marry her?” He said, “No.” Then he came again with the same question and he told him not to marry her. Then he came a third time with the same question and he said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.”</b> 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will feel proud of his ummah before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children. 
<ul>

<li>This is in accordance with what Allaah wants, which is to sustain the human race. </li>

<li>Seeking the love of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in having many children, so that he will feel proud of them before the other Prophets and nations on the Day of Resurrection. </li>

<li>Seeking barakah (blessing) and a great deal of reward, and forgiveness of sins through the du’aa’ of a righteous child after one dies. </li>
</ul>

<h4>It is well known that since ancient times children have been the hope of the Prophets and Messengers and all of the righteous slaves of Allaah.</h4>
<h4>Children are a blessing whom people love and on whom they pin their hopes upon. </h4>

Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) prayed to his Lord, saying (interpretation of the meaning): 

<b>“My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous”</b>

[al-Saafaat 37:100] 

And Allaah says of Zakariya (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 

<b>“When he called out his Lord (Allaah) a call in secret.</b>

He said: <b>‘My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble, and grey hair has spread on my head, and I have never been unblest in my invocation to You, O my Lord!

And verily, I fear my relatives after me, and my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir.

Who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya’qoob  (inheritance of the religious knowledge and Prophethood, 
not of wealth). And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are Well-Pleased!’</b>

(Allaah said) <b>‘O Zakariyya! Verily, We give you the glad tidings of a son, whose name will be Yahyaa. We have given that name to none before (him)’”</b>

[Maryam 19:3-7] 

Allaah praises His righteous slaves in many ways, such as when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 

<b>“And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqoon (the pious)’”</b>

[al-Furqaan 25:74] 



We ask Allaah to protect all the children of the Muslims. </p>

<h1> <b>“May Allah make her a blessing to you and to the ummah of Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him).”.</b> </h1>
